Miscellaneous codes for numerical computation

This repository will contain codes in Matlab and Julia as a companion to *Numerical Analysis: A Graduate course* to be published by Springer in 2022.

There are codes in [Julia](Julia), [Matlab](Matlab), and [Python](Python) for basic operations for solving equations, interpolation & approximation, computing integrals, and solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

Coverage is not and will never be complete. But there is an [errata.md](errata).
