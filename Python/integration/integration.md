# Integration methods in Python

We have the following integration methods in [`integration.py`](integration.py):

* rectangle rule `rectangle`
* trapezoidal rule `trapezoidal`
* Simpson's rule `simpson`
* mid-point rule `midpt`

and a general composite rule that uses the weights and nodes for a rule on [0,1].
