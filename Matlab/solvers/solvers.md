# Matlab equation solvers
This has a number of equation solver codes in Matlab

These include the general solvers
* bisection method [`bisect.m`](bisect.m)
* Newton method [`newton.m`](newton.m) and a guarded Newton method [`gnewton.m`](gnewton.m)
* Secant method [`secant.m`](secant.m)
* Regula Falsi [`regfalsi.m`](regfalsi.m)

and a specific solver
* for solving quadratic scalar equations [`quadratic_solver.m`](quadratic_solver.m)
